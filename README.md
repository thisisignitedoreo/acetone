# acetone
programming language that compiles into Human Resource Machine assembly

## why
idk im just bored

## quickstart
1. create a file with extension `.chco` (y'know, because acetone is (CH₃)₂CO ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)<br/>
2. write [some code](DOCUMENTATION.md) or compile one of [examples](examples/)
3. `$ python main.py ./file.chco`
4. results are printed and copied into your clipboard, click `paste` button in the game to paste it

note: the outputed assembly is **highly** unoptimized

also note: cute comment in every program at the start can be turned off with `--no-comment`<br/>
